# Networks

Network impact studies are carried out in this repository.

rumor_preferencial: preferential attachment network model is implemented and some properties such as number of nodes, diameter, clustering coefficient are analysed. In addition, the propagation of a rumour in the network is simulated.

rumor_redes: Propagation of a rumour in the Erdos-renyi, Barab√°si-Albert preferential attachment model and Watts-Strogatz small-world graph networks obtained with networkx (https://networkx.org/documentation/stable//index.html#)

rumor_renyi: Implementation of an Erdos-renyi network and the propagation of a rumour in it.
