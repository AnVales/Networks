# Networks

Network impact studies are carried out in this repository.

- erdos_renyi_drunk.py: Implementation of an Erdos-renyi network and modelling of a drunk man walking through the nodes without following any path, moving randomly.

- replicators_neutral_networks.py: Study the dynamics of a population of replicators in two neutral networks ( Erdös-Renyi network and preferential attachment network).

- rumor_preferencial.py: preferential attachment network model is implemented and some properties such as number of nodes, diameter, clustering coefficient are analysed. In addition, the propagation of a rumour in the network is simulated.

- rumor_redes.py: Propagation of a rumour in the Erdos-renyi, Barabási-Albert preferential attachment model and Watts-Strogatz small-world graph networks obtained with networkx (https://networkx.org/documentation/stable//index.html#)

- rumor_renyi.py: Implementation of an Erdos-renyi network and the propagation of a rumour in it.

- towns_epidemic.py: Implementation of an Erdos-renyi network and modelling the spread of a disease in this network (i.e. as if the network is a city).
